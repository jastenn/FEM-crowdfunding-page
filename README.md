### What I learned

I've learned a lot about technical stuff that you should do before starting a react project. Like, creating a clean outline of everything about where to break a component and where to put its state.

### Continued development

Try to do better on state management, before staring a project I must have a good visualization on when to seperate a component and where to put its state.
